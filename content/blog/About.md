# About me

## Bio

I obtained my Ph.D degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) in 2018. My major research interests lay in the area of hardware security, system security and secure architecture for AI systems. Before that I got my B.S in Electronic Science and Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) in 2012.

Though I'm not in academia anymore, I would like keep my academic profile here for archiving purpose. Below lists my publication from 2013 to 2019.
